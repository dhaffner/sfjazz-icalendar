This is a quick and dirty script to generate an iCalendar from [SFJAZZ events](https://www.sfjazz.org/calendar). The resulting $.ics$ file can be imported by many common calendar apps.

# Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dhaffner/sfjazz-icalendar.git
$ cd sfjazz.ics
$ make all
$ cat sfjazz.ics
```
